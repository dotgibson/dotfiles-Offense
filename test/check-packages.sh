# Does every package name in install/offensive-packages.txt still RESOLVE on Kali?
#
# bootstrap.sh's apt_install is deliberately forgiving: a bulk install that fails
# retries package-by-package and prints "skipped (unavailable on this box?)" for
# each casualty. That resilience is right for a live box — one dead name should not
# sink the whole install — but it means a typo, a Debian rename, or a dropped
# package is INVISIBLE. The run is still green, the operator still gets a shell, and
# the tool they were counting on simply is not there. Renames are not hypothetical
# here: install/offensive-packages.txt's own comments record freerdp2-x11 →
# freerdp3-x11 → freerdp-x11 across three years.
#
# This turns that into a gate. It resolves every name against the apt indices and
# reports the ones apt cannot see. It installs NOTHING.
#
# RUN IT WHERE THE ANSWER IS TRUE. Availability is a property of the apt sources on
# the box, so a `kali-last-snapshot` host and `kali-rolling` CI disagree by design.
# The authoritative run is the workflow (.github/workflows/packages.yml) inside a
# kali-rolling container; locally this is a smoke test against whatever you track,
# which is why an unresolvable name prints the suite it was checked against.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every name resolved (or a clean skip: no apt on this host)
#   1  usage/environment failure
#   2  one or more names did not resolve — the drift signal
#
# Usage:

# Name the suite so a local run's answer is interpretable. `apt-cache policy`'s FIRST
# release line is the dpkg status pseudo-release (a=now), which is not a suite — skip it.
#
# TAKING THE FIRST REAL ARCHIVE AFTER THAT IS NOT ENOUGH, which is what this used to do.
# apt lists EVERY configured source, third-party repos included, and those routinely
# label themselves `a=stable`. On a Kali box carrying one, the first real archive is the
# third party's and this printed `apt suite in view: stable` — naming a suite the names
# were NOT checked against, on a box actually resolving them against kali-last-snapshot.
# That inverts the label's whole purpose: an operator reads "does NOT resolve against
# stable", concludes the run was a Debian-stable false alarm, and dismisses a real drift
# signal (or, as happened, misreads a correct one). Observed with the Yazi repo's
# `o=Yazi,a=stable` sorting ahead of four `o=Kali` lines.
#
# So prefer the archive of the KALI-origin source — that is the one the manifest is
# written against — and fall back to the old first-real-archive rule only when no Kali
# source is configured (a non-Kali box, where the answer is advisory anyway).

Each of these is one of:
  • a rename       — find the new name and update the manifest
  • a drop         — remove it, or move it to an UPSTREAM comment with install notes
  • a typo         — fix it
  • suite drift    — real on rolling, absent on the snapshot you happen to track
