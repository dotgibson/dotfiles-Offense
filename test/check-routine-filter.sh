# test/check-routine-filter.sh — does the routine filer still catch a BLOCKED run?
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# .github/workflows/file-routine-issue.sh has to tell three things apart: genuine
# findings, a run the model API blocked at the cybersecurity safety filter, and any other
# failed run. It got that wrong once already. The original guard matched the July-2026
# refusal wording with a single grep (issue #112); the API reworded the refusal (issue
# #177); the grep went blind; the raw API error was filed under the NORMAL findings title,
# where it then DEDUPED into the findings issue because the advisory title suffix never
# applied. Nothing went red — a human reading the issue is what caught it. This is the
# gate that catches it next time.
#
# It drives the REAL script end-to-end instead of re-testing a copy of its pattern: a
# copied regex IS the drift this exists to prevent, and half the bug lived in the
# COMPOSITION (the title — i.e. the dedup key), which a pattern test cannot see. The
# harness is a stub `gh` on PATH plus RUNNER_TEMP pointed at a scratch dir, so the helper
# runs exactly as claude-routines.yml runs it while touching no network and needing no
# GH_TOKEN.
#
# Cases — the two refusals are VERBATIM from the real incidents:
#   1. #112 (Jul 2026) "…safety measures that flagged this message for a cybersecurity
#      topic…"                                                   → BLOCKED advisory
#   2. #177 (Aug 2026) "…safeguards flagged this message… Cyber Verification Program…",
#      the reword that broke the old grep                        → BLOCKED advisory
#   3. a genuine multi-section report that QUOTES #112's wording in its prose — the trap
#      the shape-before-signal split exists for                  → normal findings title
#   4. a bare `Execution error` — the non-cyber failure branch   → FAILED advisory
#
# Exit codes (matching this repo's check-script convention — see
# test/check-companion-freshness.sh):
#   0  every case passed, OR a graceful skip (helper absent, no mktemp)
#   1  a case FAILED — the classifier or the composed title/body regressed
# There is deliberately no exit-2 "drift" state here: a red case is a bug, not a nudge, so
# the workflow can treat this as an ordinary pass/fail gate.

## methodology-review — findings

### 1. Deprecated flag in `offensive/hacktheplanet`

`nmap --script-updatedb` is documented as a warm-up step; the packaged nmap
regenerates the script DB on demand, so the line is noise.

### 2. Renamed binary

`nuclei -t cves/` should be `nuclei -t http/cves/` — the template tree moved and
install/offensive-packages.txt already carries the new name.

### 3. Nothing to carry over

Last week the run was blocked upstream ("safety measures that flagged this message for a cybersecurity topic"); this run completed, so there is no backlog.
