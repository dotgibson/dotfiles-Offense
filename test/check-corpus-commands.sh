# Does every command the RED CORPUS tells an operator to run actually exist?
#
# Two entries in `coerce-petitpotam` once invoked `impacket-petitpotam` and `dfscoerce`.
# Neither is a real command — PetitPotam is topotam/PetitPotam and was never an impacket
# script; DFSCoerce is a git clone with no binary on PATH. A human found them by reading
# the file, because NO GATE ON EITHER SIDE COULD:
#
#   gen-views.sh --check     byte-compares the 19 PROJECTED red blocks against their
#                            entries. 87 of 106 red entries are unprojected — invisible.
#   check-packages.sh        resolves names in install/offensive-packages.txt. It reads the
#                            MANIFEST, and has never looked at the corpus.
#   companion integrity      compares the vendored tree to companion.lock. Provenance, not
#                            content: a wrong command hashes exactly as well as a right one.
#   htpx CI (upstream)       pair: symmetry and {{slot}} coverage. Structure, not existence.
#
# Nothing in that list asks *does this command exist?* — and an unprojected entry is just
# as operational as a projected one: ~/companion is symlinked, `htpx` is a first-class
# alias, and `clip` puts the line straight on the clipboard. See dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense#208.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It answers "does this resolve", never "is this still the right
# flag" — `--filter-method-name Efs` vs a patched `EfsRpcOpenFileRaw` is a judgement for
# /doc-audit and /tool-scout. It is a floor, not a review.
#
# ⚠ WHEN THIS GOES RED ON A companion-sync PR, THE FIX IS USUALLY NOT HERE.
# offensive/companion/ is a vendored subtree of dotgibson/htpx; CONTRIBUTING §2 and the
# companion-integrity gate both forbid hand-editing it. A bad command in an entry is fixed
# UPSTREAM in htpx and arrives via scripts/sync-companion.sh. What lands here is either a
# manifest addition (the tool is real, we just never listed it) or a classification line in
# install/corpus-commands.lst (the tool is deliberately not on the operator's box).
#
# It reads only the tree — never apt, never the network, never the local box — so it is
# deterministic enough to be a REQUIRED check. (check-packages.sh is advisory precisely
# because it must ask apt, and kali-rolling moves under it.)
#
# Exit codes (this repo's check-script convention — see test/check-routine-filter.sh):
#   0  every command resolves, or a graceful skip (no corpus vendored here)
#   1  usage/environment failure, or a broken corpus invariant the parser relies on
#   2  an unresolved command, or a classification no entry uses any more — the drift signal
#
# Usage:
#   test/check-corpus-commands.sh                  # offensive/companion/entries/red
#   test/check-corpus-commands.sh <entries-dir>    # a fixture (disables the stale check)
#   test/check-corpus-commands.sh --self-test      # prove the #208 escapes still redden it

An unresolved command is one of:
  • a tool that is real but was never listed — add it to install/offensive-packages.txt
  • a tool that is real but not in apt      — add it there as an `# X → UPSTREAM (...)`
                                               line, then classify it `upstream` here
  • a binary whose package has another name — classify it `pkg:<apt-name>` here
  • a thing that runs on the TARGET, not on the operator's box — classify it `elsewhere`
  • a command that does not exist at all    — fix the ENTRY, and note that
                                               offensive/companion/ is a vendored subtree:
                                               the fix lands UPSTREAM in dotgibson/htpx and
                                               arrives via scripts/sync-companion.sh
A stale classification means the entry that needed it is gone — delete the line.
