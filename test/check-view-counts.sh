# VIEW COUNTS — do the flat views still state the corpus's REAL sizes?
#
# `offensive/hacktheplanet`, `PURPLE-TEAM.md` and `OFFENSIVE-METHODOLOGY.md` each open
# with a paragraph explaining how much of the companion corpus they project and how much
# they deliberately do not. Those paragraphs quote NUMBERS — 106 red, 105 blue, 19
# projected, 24 projected, 211 overall — and every one is hand-typed. Two of the three
# files say so about themselves: "These counts are hand-maintained and go stale on every
# companion-sync. If they disagree with `ls offensive/companion/entries/blue | wc -l`,
# this file is wrong, not the corpus." This gate is that sentence, executed.
#
# THEY HAD GONE STALE, TWICE. CHANGELOG's v2.10.0 entry records fixing exactly this; the
# v2.10.1 sync broke it again (dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense#261, #262). Nothing noticed,
# because nothing looked:
#
#   gen-views.sh --check     byte-compares the CONTENT of each generated block against its
#                            entry. It has no opinion on how many blocks exist, and none at
#                            all on the hand-authored prose around them.
#   companion-freshness      is the vendored subtree behind htpx? A count in a sentence is
#                            not a subtree.
#   companion-integrity      tree SHA vs companion.lock. Provenance, not prose.
#   check-corpus-commands    do the corpus's COMMANDS resolve? Never reads the views.
#   markdownlint             style. `101` and `102` lint identically.
#
# WHY THIS GATE IS REPO-OWNED AND LIVES HERE. The numbers describe the vendored corpus,
# but the SENTENCES are this repo's own hand-authored prose — hacktheplanet and
# PURPLE-TEAM.md are repo-owned files. offensive/companion/ is a git-subtree copy of
# dotgibson/htpx, overwritten by scripts/sync-companion.sh, so gen-views.sh cannot be
# extended to do this: an edit there is lost on the next sync. The gate belongs on this
# side of the boundary because the thing that goes stale is on this side.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT CHECK — deliberately, and this is not a backlog. Every remaining figure in
# those paragraphs is a SEMANTIC CLASSIFICATION of an entry's content, not a property of
# the tree: 59 cloud/SaaS/CI-CD red, 13 C2-egress/Impact, 7 Linux post-ex, 72 red
# corpus-only, 79 blue corpus-only, 151 combined, and the 68%/75% shares. (The
# no-event-ID count is now derived and checked — claim 3 — so it is no longer here.)
# Nothing in entries/*.md marks an entry "cloud"; a human read the corpus
# and assigned those buckets. Re-implementing that judgement in grep would be wrong more
# often than the prose is. Percentages are ungated for a second reason: which way to round
# a share that lands on .5 is an editorial call, and a gate that overrules it is a
# nuisance. Those
# slots appear as `-` in the claim table below, so the blind spots are reviewable source
# rather than an omission. The ONE exact relation that IS free — the combined numerator
# must equal the sum of the two stated numerators — is checked as tier 2.
#
# MATCHING STRATEGY, and it is the fragile part; three decisions:
#
#   1. Match a FLATTENED copy. All these sentences wrap mid-clause and two live inside a
#      markdown blockquote, so every line carries `> `. Strip the quote markers, fold
#      newlines to spaces, squeeze runs. A reflow, an added word or a `gq` pass then costs
#      nothing. That is the biggest fragility reduction available to a prose check.
#   2. ASCII-ONLY anchors that never cross an em dash. These sentences contain U+2014;
#      under LC_ALL=C that is three bytes and `.` is one, so any pattern spanning one is a
#      byte-width trap. Every anchor below stops short of the dashes.
#   3. POSITIONAL digit slots. One ERE per claim; its [0-9]+ runs are compared left to
#      right against a table, with `-` for a slot the gate cannot derive.
#
# THE ANCHOR IS THE COUPLING, and rewriting a sentence WILL break it. That is a different
# failure from a stale number and gets a different exit code and a different message, so a
# maintainer is never told "the count is wrong" when the real answer is "re-anchor me".
#
# REPORTER, not mutator — it never writes to the tree.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every derivable number in the prose matches the tree, or a graceful skip
#   1  the gate could not do its job: not a work tree, no corpus, a broken gen/end marker
#      pairing, or an anchor that no longer matches exactly once (the prose was rewritten)
#   2  DRIFT — the prose states a number the tree contradicts. This is the signal.
#
# Usage:
#   test/check-view-counts.sh        # or: make view-counts
