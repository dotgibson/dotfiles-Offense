# dotfiles-Offense/bootstrap.sh
# Wire the OFFENSIVE (red) role layer onto an already-provisioned box.
# Distro-agnostic: installs NOTHING by default (your OS-native layer does that).
# Idempotent. Stacks: vendored Core + your OS-native layer + OFFENSIVE role.
#
# This repo used to be BOTH an OS-native layer for Kali and a role layer on top of it.
# The OS half now lives in dotfiles-Debian, which accepts ID=kali as a first-class
# target — so the apt base list, the SHA-pinned out-of-band installs, the WSL bootstrap
# and the ssh/git/zsh OS overlays all moved there. What is left here is the role.
#
# The SHARED half of a bootstrap — link-with-backup, the Core symlink surface, the
# managed ~/.zshrc loader — is CALLED out of core/lib/bootstrap-lib.sh, not copied.
# What stays here is the genuinely offensive part: the tool probe, the opt-in tool
# installer, and the band-85 role stage.
#
# >>>USAGE
#   ./bootstrap.sh                 # symlinks + loader + the host-tool probe
#   ./bootstrap.sh --links-only    # just (re)create symlinks (no probe)
#   ./bootstrap.sh --no-check      # skip the host-tool probe
#   ./bootstrap.sh --install       # OPT-IN: also install the offensive tool stack
#   ./bootstrap.sh --dry-run       # print the whole plan, change nothing
#   ./bootstrap.sh --only zsh,nvim # link ONLY these Core module groups
#   ./bootstrap.sh --skip tmux     # link everything EXCEPT these groups
#
# Module groups (for --only/--skip): zsh nvim tmux git prompt tools — Core wiring
# only; the band-85 role stage rides `zsh`.

#   other Debian  → a PORTABLE SUBSET via pipx + go. Debian and Ubuntu package almost
#                   none of it, so the alternative to this subset is nothing at all.
#   anything else → refuse, and say so. Guessing a package manager here would install

#
# The subset is small ON PURPOSE. It is the set that (a) installs cleanly from PyPI or
# the Go module proxy with no system libraries to chase, and (b) offensive.zsh actually
# probes. Everything else — responder, evil-winrm, metasploit, hashcat, burp — has real
# packaging behind it and belongs to your OS layer or an upstream installer, not to a
# best-effort loop here.
#
# NAME MISMATCH, and it is deliberate rather than a bug to fix: pipx's impacket installs
# `secretsdump.py`, not Kali's `impacket-secretsdump` wrapper, and PyPI certipy-ad
# installs `certipy`, not `certipy-ad`. offensive.zsh probes the KALI names, so those
# HAVE_* flags will not fire on a pipx box. _probe_altname above teaches the report to
# recognise both, so at least the report tells the truth; making the shell layer resolve
