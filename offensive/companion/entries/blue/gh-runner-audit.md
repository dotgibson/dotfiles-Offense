The `*.register_self_hosted_runner` family is the invariant — GitHub emits it
scoped to where the runner is bound (`repo.`/`org.`/`enterprise.`). The paired red
registers at repo scope, but the detection keys on all three so org- and
enterprise-scope registration isn't left dark. Self-hosted runners are rare and
long-lived, so a new registration — especially from an unexpected actor, on a
public repo, or with a label that shadows an existing pool — is a strong tell that
someone is positioning to harvest job secrets. Pair with the org's known-runner
inventory and alert on any registration outside change control.

GitHub Enterprise audit-log telemetry, companion-only — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is on-prem
Windows.

```spl
index=github sourcetype=github:audit action IN ("repo.register_self_hosted_runner", "org.register_self_hosted_runner", "enterprise.register_self_hosted_runner")
| table _time, actor, action, repo, org, business
```
