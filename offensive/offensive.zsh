# The OFFENSIVE role layer. Linked as ~/.config/zsh/85-offensive.zsh, so the loader
# picks it up in the role band (85-94) — after your OS-native layer, before host-local:
#   tools → aliases → functions → fzf → bindings → plugins → op → os → OFFENSIVE → local
#
# This is a ROLE layer: it stacks on whatever OS-native layer the box already runs
# (dotfiles-Debian covers Kali). It owns no package manager, no clipboard, no paths.
#
# Same discipline as Core: every alias/function touching an optional tool is
# GUARDED by a HAVE_* flag, so this file is inert on a box where the tool isn't
# installed instead of erroring on shell start. Nothing here is target-specific
# — it's tool ergonomics + engagement scaffolding only.
#
# ⚠ SCOPE: every tool below is for AUTHORIZED engagements with written ROE only.
#   `mkengagement` seeds a scope.txt FIRST for exactly this reason.
#
# Engagement DATA never lives in this repo — it lives in $ENGAGEMENTS_DIR
# (default ~/engagements), which the repo .gitignore also blocks as a backstop.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Interactive shells only — scripts get raw POSIX (mirrors Core's 00-tools.zsh).

# that carry their OWN updater and rot between apt syncs — nuclei's TEMPLATES (they move
# daily) plus its engine ONLY where that build has `-update`: Kali patches the engine
# self-updater out because apt owns the binary, so there redup refreshes templates alone
# and neither runs nor tallies the engine step. Then katana's crawler engine — same reason,
# but katana needs a SECOND probe, because Kali does not patch its updater out and apt can
# own a binary whose `-update` is still live; see its own note below — and searchsploit's
# exploit-DB,
# plus any go-installed fast-movers registered in go_fast_movers below — an empty array
# today, see the note there. Run it DELIBERATELY on your attacker box — NEVER on a
# client/engagement host mid-op, where updating a tool under a working chain is exactly
# how you break it. On Kali the searchsploit step makes that warning stronger than it
# sounds: `searchsploit -u` there is an APT TRANSACTION, not a data-dir refresh, so redup
# can move package state on the box it runs on.
# Each step is guarded by tool presence (command -v, not _have — that's unfunctioned at
# load). It only ever runs each tool's own updater; it installs nothing new and touches
# no engagement data.

  # katana — a fast mover (six releases in nine months) that ships its own `-update`. That
  # self-updater is why it lives HERE and not in go_fast_movers below; the reasoning is on
  # that list. It is no longer "go-only": apt carries it as of 2026-08-31, which is exactly
  # why the guard below grew a second question rather than staying a flag probe.
  #
  # THE FLAG IS PROBED, not assumed — the same guard and the SAME regex as the nuclei engine
  # step above. This is no longer preventive: katana 1.7.0-0kali1 MIGRATED to kali-rolling on
  # 2026-08-31, so on a current Kali box apt owns /usr/bin/katana today (the manifest entry in
  # install/offensive-packages.txt is a plain apt line now, not an UPSTREAM pointer). apt
  # owning a binary is exactly when Kali patches the self-updater out — it already did so to
  # nuclei's `-update` — and an unconditional step here would tally a red failure on EVERY run
  # of a completely healthy box. That is the miscount the nuclei comment above exists to
  # prevent; there is no reason to learn it a second time from the same function.
  #
  # THE WHOLE-TOKEN MATCH EARNS ITS KEEP HERE TOO. katana's help carries `-duc,
  # -disable-update-check`, which a bare `grep -- -update` matches — concluding the flag
  # exists on precisely the patched build the probe is meant to catch. The leading
  # `(^|[[:space:],])` is what kills that hit (the preceding char is `e`). `2>&1` is kept
  # because goflags routes `-h` through stderr on some builds.
  #
  # THE FLAG PROBE IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN, and katana is where that breaks (#299). The
  # nuclei step above can stop at the flag because Kali PATCHES nuclei's self-updater out
  # (`Disable-update.patch`), so an apt-owned nuclei fails the probe and skips. Kali's
  # katana carries no such patch: apt can own the binary while `-update` is still present
  # and advertised. The probe passes, the update then tries to replace a dpkg-owned
  # /usr/bin/katana as a normal user, gologger.Fatal()s, and this step prints
  # `✗ katana update failed` on EVERY run of a completely healthy box — the exact miscount
  # the nuclei comment above exists to prevent, arriving through the branch that comment
  # does not cover. So the second question is: can this process actually write the binary?
  #
  # AND THE ANSWER TO "not writable" IS TO SKIP, NOT TO SUDO — the one place this does NOT
  # mirror searchsploit's `-w` probe above, which escalates. Escalating here would overwrite
  # a dpkg-owned file that the next `apt upgrade` reverts, leaving redup and apt fighting
  # over /usr/bin/katana. Not writable means apt owns it, and apt-owned tools are `up`'s
  # job, not this list's — the same ownership rule already applied to ffuf/gobuster/
  # azurehound/kubectl/wpscan/nikto below. So it is a neutral skip line, not a red tally:
  # nothing was refreshed, and nothing failed either.
  #
  # BOTH the file and its directory are tested because katana's updater may write in place
  # or write-then-rename, and a rename needs the DIRECTORY bit. Testing both means this
  # guard does not depend on knowing which one ProjectDiscovery's updateutils uses today.

  # go-installed, apt-ABSENT fast-movers (see install/offensive-packages.txt UPSTREAM
  # notes). REINSTALL-ONLY: each tool is guarded by its OWN binary, so redup never installs
  # something new — it only re-fetches @latest for a tool you already have. Curated to the
  # go-ONLY tools; apt-packaged ones (gobuster/ffuf) are `up`'s job, not this list's. `go`
  # must be present.
  #
  # That is a claim about OWNERSHIP, not about currency, and the old wording ("update via
  # `up`") blurred the two. apt owns those binaries, so `up` is the only correct route and
  # they stay out of here — but it does NOT follow that apt keeps them CURRENT.
  #
  # THE STANDING COUNTER-EXAMPLE IS httpx-toolkit (#299). It used to be ffuf — "kali sits on
  # 2.1.0 (imported Jan 2024) while upstream resumed and is on 2.2.x" — and that example DIED:
  # kali imported ffuf 2.2.1-1 on 2026-09-02 and is now at upstream head, as is gobuster. An
  # example that resolves itself stops teaching, so it is replaced rather than deleted:
  # httpx-toolkit has sat at 1.9.0-0kali2 since 2026-05-18 while upstream cut 1.10.0 and
  # 1.11.0, and Kali does NOT patch its self-updater out. That gap is still apt's to close,
  # not redup's; `go install`-ing over a packaged binary just leaves two of them and no
  # clarity about which one is on PATH.
  #
  # The list is EMPTY by design: kerbrute (the former sole entry) is upstream-frozen (last
  # release v1.0.3, Dec 2019), so `go install …/kerbrute@latest` every run just re-fetched
  # an unchanging commit — a no-op that padded the "refreshed" tally. Dropped; kerbrute is a
  # manual UPSTREAM install (release binary / `go install`, never apt-packaged — see its note
  # in install/offensive-packages.txt), so redup dropping it changes nothing about how you get
  # or keep it. Keep this machinery for the next genuinely fast-moving go-only tool: add a
  # `bin=module@latest` pair to go_fast_movers.
  #
  # katana was the obvious candidate for that slot and was deliberately NOT put in it:
  # upstream's documented install is `CGO_ENABLED=1 go install`, while the loop below runs a
  # bare `go install` — an entry here would build katana differently from the documented
  # build. It carries its own `-update`, so it took the self-updater route above instead.
  #
  # `gh` was the second candidate — go-only, apt-ABSENT (2.46.0-3 was REMOVED from
  # kali-rolling 2025-12-10 and has not returned), and genuinely fast-moving, which is the
  # exact profile this machinery was kept for. It was rejected anyway, on a different ground
  # from katana's: upstream supports the release binary and GitHub's own apt repo, NOT
  # `go install`, and a bare `go install` build reports an unset/dev version string. The
  # binary would then lie about itself to every `gh --version` — and to every issue this
  # layer's operator files from it. The loop is also reinstall-only, so it would fire only on
  # a box that already has gh; and the routes that install gh correctly are the same routes
  # that keep it current. An entry here would replace a correct build with a worse one that
  # cannot report its own version. See the `# gh → UPSTREAM` pointer under Cloud / SaaS /
  # CI-CD in install/offensive-packages.txt for the install route that IS right.
  #
  # Two candidates evaluated, two rejected. The list stays empty by REASON, not by neglect.
