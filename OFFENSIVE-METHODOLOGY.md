# Offensive Methodology — the TTP map behind the tool layer

This is the "why" for `offensive/offensive.zsh` and `install/offensive-packages.txt`:
how the tools line up against a real engagement and against **MITRE ATT&CK**, which
is the through-line the whole industry (and adversary-emulation tooling like
Caldera) organizes around. It's a reference, not a runbook — every step is gated
on **written authorization and a defined scope**.

> Looking for the concrete, copy-paste command syntax per service/port? That's
> the field reference in [`offensive/hacktheplanet`](offensive/hacktheplanet) —
> this doc is the map, that file is the commands. (Symlinked to `~/hacktheplanet`
> by `bootstrap.sh`; `htp` opens it.) Companion field references sit at the
> same altitude: [`offensive/exploitdev`](offensive/exploitdev) (`xdev`) for binary
> exploitation, and [`offensive/evasion`](offensive/evasion) (`evade`) for AV/AMSI/
> AppLocker evasion and breaching hardened defenses. One altitude *up* — the
> working **method** that decides which command you reach for and what to do when
> you're stuck (the "always be running recon" loop, shell stabilization, the
> scripted pseudo-shell) — is [`offensive/ippsec`](offensive/ippsec) (`ipp`),
> distilled from IppSec's HTB catalog. The defensive mirror — what each attack
> trips, as Splunk/Sentinel detections — is in [`PURPLE-TEAM.md`](PURPLE-TEAM.md).

> Rule zero: `mkengagement` writes `scope/scope.txt` *before* anything else and
> opens it in your editor. Fill it in first. Installing a tool is not permission
> to point it at anything.

## The phase → ATT&CK → tool map

| Phase | ATT&CK tactic(s) | Go-to tools (this layer) | Workspace dir |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Recon** | Reconnaissance (TA0043) | amass, subfinder, dnsx, bbot, theharvester, masscan | `recon/` |
| **Scanning / enum** | Discovery (TA0007) | `nmapsweep`, nxc (smb/ldap/winrm), enum4linux-ng, ldapdomaindump (apt: python3-ldapdomaindump) | `scans/` |
| **Initial access** | Initial Access (TA0001) | nuclei/httpx-toolkit/katana (katana: `go install`, not apt), ffuf/feroxbuster, sqlmap, Burp, responder | `web/`, `exploit/` |
| **Cred access** | Credential Access (TA0006) | nxc, impacket (secretsdump), responder, hashcat/john, certipy-ad, sccmhunter (SCCM/MECM NAA + site takeover; upstream, not apt) | `loot/creds`, `loot/hashes` |
| **AD attack-path mapping** | Discovery / PrivEsc | **`bhce`** → BloodHound CE, bloodhound-ce-python, SharpHound | `loot/bloodhound` |
| **Lateral movement** | Lateral Movement (TA0008) | nxc (exec over smb/winrm/mssql), impacket-psexec, evil-winrm | `notes.md` |
| **Privilege escalation** | Privilege Escalation (TA0004) | certipy-ad (AD CS), BloodHound paths, impacket | — |
| **C2 / persistence** | Command & Control (TA0011) | Sliver, AdaptixC2, Metasploit, Caldera (emulation); Havoc only if you already run it — upstream is archived | — |
| **Pivoting** | Lateral Movement | ligolo-ng, chisel, proxychains4, socat | — |
| **Reporting** | — | your notes + `logshell` transcript | `report/`, `notes.md` |

> **This table maps the on-prem network/AD engagement — that's the whole scope it
> claims.** Cloud/SaaS/identity (AWS, Entra, GCP, Okta, Snowflake), Kubernetes, and
> CI-CD supply chain (Jenkins, GitHub/GitLab runners, npm/PyPI, Terraform Cloud,
> Vault), plus the Impact tactic and the C2 tradecraft past the one row above, live in
> the **companion corpus** — `htpx` (`~/companion`), where each attack is paired with
> its detection. That material is **69 of the 103 red entries (67%) and 76 of the 101
> blue (75%)** — 145 of 204 overall — and none of it is projected into
> `hacktheplanet` or `PURPLE-TEAM.md`; the corpus is the map for it. (Counts are
> hand-maintained per `companion-sync`; both files carry the same caveat.)
> The CLIs those entries invoke are accounted for in
> [`install/offensive-packages.txt`](install/offensive-packages.txt).

### The one naming change that bites people

**CrackMapExec is gone — it's `nxc` (NetExec) now.** CME was archived in 2023; the
community fork NetExec is the maintained successor and the single highest-leverage
tool in the kit: SMB / LDAP / WinRM / MSSQL / RDP / FTP / SSH auth, enumeration,
lateral movement, credential extraction, *and* BloodHound collection — one
scriptable interface. The old `crackmapexec`/`cme` muscle memory just becomes `nxc`.

### BloodHound is now BloodHound CE

The legacy BloodHound 4.x collectors don't cleanly ingest into Community Edition.
Use a **CE-compatible collector** — the `bhce` helper drives nxc's `--bloodhound`
module, which packages a CE-ready zip into `loot/bloodhound/`. BloodHound CE itself
is a Postgres-backed web app, not an apt package: stand it up with SpecterOps'
official `bloodhound-cli` (a Go binary — curl the release or `go install`), which
now owns the compose file under an XDG config dir.

## OPSEC / engagement hygiene baked into the layer

- **Scope first.** `scope/scope.txt` lists in-scope, out-of-scope, the auth
  reference, the time window, and an emergency "stop" contact. If it's blank,
  you're not ready to run.
- **Everything in `~/engagements`, never in the repo.** `$ENGAGEMENTS_DIR` lives
  outside any git tree; the Kali repo's paranoid `.gitignore` is only a backstop.
  Client data in a public showcase repo is a career-ender.
- **Audit trail.** `logshell` records a `script(1)` transcript into the
  engagement's `notes/` so you can reconstruct exactly what you ran and when —
  for the report and for deconfliction. `note "<text>"` adds timestamped
  observations to `notes.md` as you go (IppSec's note discipline — see
  [`offensive/ippsec`](offensive/ippsec)): capture every state change, cred, and
  host the instant it happens so the report writes itself.
- **WSL2 gotcha (already in PORTING-MATRIX).** A listener / reverse shell in Kali
  under WSL2 isn't reachable from your LAN until you set
  `networkingMode=mirrored` in the **Windows-side** `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`
  (Win11 22H2+) — not `/etc/wsl.conf`. Bites every Sliver/Responder/C2 setup.

## What I deliberately did NOT put in the repo

- No payloads, implants, shellcode, or exploit code. Those are generated
  per-engagement, live in `exploit/` under `~/engagements`, and never sync.
- No target lists, creds, or loot. Same reason.
- No C2 server is vendored. Sliver and AdaptixC2 are now apt packages (so `up`
  carries them); Caldera stays an install *pointer* — it carries its own update
  cadence, and it moved from MITRE to the **Apache Incubator** (May 2026, now
  `apache/caldera`; `mitre/caldera` redirects), so the slower release rhythm is
  that transition rather than EOL. Configuring any of them is per-engagement work, and
  AdaptixC2's shipped defaults are fingerprinted, so treat "installed" as the
  starting line.

The dotfiles job is to make the **toolset and workspace** reproducible across
boxes. The tradecraft stays in your head and in the (private, out-of-repo)
engagement notes.
