# The report is a routine's own stdout, republished into an issue a maintainer — and,

# tokens below, so this is a NO-OP on the normal path; it is not a fix for a live leak
# (the filed bodies have been clean). It hardens the publish boundary so that if a report
# ever quotes an instruction-shaped tag — from a doc it audits, or captured harness text —
# the tag reaches the issue as inert literal text, never as something a downstream reader
# can act on. Curated to harness/instruction tokens with no legitimate use as an
# offensive-doc placeholder, so real placeholders (<ip_address>, <user>, <pass>) and
# <https://…> autolinks pass through untouched.

# Run-status classification: SHAPE first, then SIGNAL.
#
# The model API can refuse a routine's request outright — a REQUEST-level error, not
# findings. Filed verbatim, that once masqueraded as a real report (an "audit" whose only
# content was the error — issue #112). The guard added then matched that July-2026 wording
# with a single grep; the API later REWORDED the refusal (issue #177 — "…safeguards
# flagged this message…"), the grep went blind, and the raw error was filed under the
# normal findings title again — where it also DEDUPED into the findings issue, because the
# advisory title suffix never applied. Refusal prose churns; the SHAPE of a failed run
# does not. So:
#
#   SHAPE  — is this a failed run at all? The CLI prints request-level errors RAW, so a
#            failure BEGINS with `API Error:` / `Execution error`; a genuine report is
#            markdown and never does. Testing the FIRST non-blank line — not "anywhere in
#            the file" — also fixes the opposite defect the old grep had: a real report
#            that merely QUOTES an API error was matched and misfiled as a block, which a
#            doc-hygiene report legitimately does when it mentions last week's run.
#   SIGNAL — given a failure, is it the cyber filter? Deliberately broad and multi-anchor:
#            the nouns both wordings share, plus the two links. URLs and programme names
#            outlive the sentences around them.
#
# Anything else is a generic run failure. Either way we file a clearly-labelled advisory
# under a DISTINCT title — distinct from the findings title AND from the other advisory,
# so nothing can ever dedup across the three — then warn, but stay green (exit 0),
# matching the preflight no-op posture. Nothing in the repo is ever edited.
# test/check-routine-filter.sh is the regression gate on all of this.
