# Changelog

All notable changes to this repo's own layer — the offensive role layer
(`offensive/`, `install/`), `bootstrap.sh`, and the tooling around the two vendored
subtrees.

**Not** in scope: changes inside `core/` or `offensive/companion/`. Those are
vendored copies with their own changelogs
([dotfiles-core](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md),
[htpx](https://github.com/dotgibson/htpx)). A sync that bumps `core.lock` or
`companion.lock` is worth a line here; the upstream contents are not.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This repo is auto-patch-tagged by CI on a vendored-subtree bump, so version
headings record what was vendored at a point in time rather than a maintained
release line.

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **Engagement-data write guard.** `note`, `logshell`, `bhce` and `nmapsweep` used
  to fall back to `$PWD` when `$ENGAGEMENT` was unset, so running them inside a
  checkout wrote client data into that repo. They now resolve their root through
  `_eng_writeroot`, which refuses any `$PWD` inside a git work tree.
- **The field references open read-only.** `htp`/`xdev`/`evade`/`ipp` are symlinks
  to tracked files, and `hacktheplanet`'s "target fill" recipe told you to
  substitute the real client IP/hostname/domain into the buffer — one `:w` from
  publishing engagement data. They now open with `-R`; `htp -w` edits deliberately,
  and the fill recipe writes a copy under `$ENGAGEMENT`.
- **`.gitignore` backstop repaired.** `*.xml` carried a trailing comment, which
  gitignore does not support — the pattern was the whole line and matched nothing,
  leaving nmap `-oX` output unguarded. The ignore list also described the
  *template's* directory names rather than the ones `mkengagement` creates, so
  `scope/`, `recon/`, `scans/`, `web/`, `screenshots/`, `exploit/` and `notes.md`
  were all unblocked.
- **Pinned + verified tool installs.** The five `curl | sh` installers are gone.
  `install/tool-versions.env` pins each tool's version and the SHA-256 of its
  release asset; `bootstrap.sh` verifies before installing and fails closed.
  `starship` moved to apt, which packages it.
- **Secret scanning in CI** — gitleaks over the working tree and full history.
- **`hethttp` refuses to serve a git work tree** on `0.0.0.0`.
- **`bhce` can take credentials off argv** — `op://…` resolves through 1Password,
  `-` prompts with echo off.

### Removed

- **The `core_branch` fallback in the two `core.lock` readers.** `core_branch` was
  renamed `core_ref` in dotfiles-core#453, and reading both names was correct while it
  shipped: this repo vendors Core on its own schedule, so locks of both vintages existed
  in the wild and reading only the new name would have killed `sync-core.sh` on any repo
  that had not yet synced. That window is closed — Core declares the field **gone as of
  v5** in `VENDORING.md`, and no `core.lock` in the fleet carries it, this repo's
  included. Gone with it: `migrate_branch_to_ref`, which rewrote the old key in place so
  `set_field` (which replaces, never inserts) would have a line to hit. Nothing needs
  that any more — `sync-core.sh` now dies naming `core_ref` alone, before the pull, if
  the lock has no such line, which is what licenses the never-insert rule downstream.
  `test/check-core-freshness.sh` keeps its soft `branch=main` default: it is a watcher,
  not a writer. The `CORE_BRANCH` **env override** is untouched — it is that script's own
  knob, not a lock field (#271).

### Fixed

- **`check-packages.sh` named a suite it had not checked against.** The label exists so a
  local run is interpretable — the script's own comment says an unresolvable name "prints
  the suite it was checked against" — but it took the first real archive from
  `apt-cache policy`, and apt lists every configured source. Third-party repos routinely
  label themselves `a=stable`, so on a Kali box carrying one (observed: Yazi's
  `o=Yazi,a=stable` sorting ahead of four `o=Kali` lines) it printed
  `apt suite in view: stable` while actually resolving against `kali-last-snapshot`. That
  inverts the label's purpose: an operator reads "does NOT resolve against stable",
  assumes a Debian-stable false alarm, and dismisses a real drift signal. It now prefers
  the archive of the **Kali-origin** source and falls back to the old first-real-archive
  rule only where no Kali source is configured. Verified across five cases: Kali behind a
  third-party repo, Kali alone, a non-Kali Debian box (fallback unchanged), a release line
  with no `o=`, and empty policy output.

- **`bootstrap.sh`'s `PATH` is not the shell's `PATH` — adopt `blib_user_bindirs_on_path`**
  (dotgibson/dotfiles-core#748). Replaces the hand-rolled `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"` prelude, which also moves it below the `source core/lib/bootstrap-lib.sh` line. `~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin` and `$GOBIN` reach
  `PATH` only through the zsh layer, i.e. only inside a Core shell — which does not exist
  while `bootstrap.sh` runs. So every `command -v <tool>` guard here was answered by the
  PATH of whatever shell launched the bootstrap: on a fresh box, bash, with none of them.
  That is wasted work when the guard picks whether to reinstall, and a **wrong answer** when
  it picks a branch — `dotfiles-openSUSE` probed `command -v mise` for a mise `mise.run` had
  written to `~/.local/bin` moments earlier, both arms of its Go fallback missed, and the run
  exited 2 on every bootstrap. No stubbed CI leg can see that: a stub installs nothing, so
  "is the tool present afterwards" can never fail under one. Core has shipped
  `blib_user_bindirs_on_path` for exactly this since dotgibson/dotfiles-core#425 — it resolves
  `CARGO_HOME` and `GOBIN`/`GOPATH` rather than hard-coding them, and adds only directories
  that **exist**, so it is called again after an installer creates one. The directory `--install` writes into is `mkdir -p`'d before the helper runs: the helper adds only directories that already **exist**, so a straight swap for the old unconditional `export` would have dropped `~/.local/bin` for the whole first run and sent the probe/report phase back to reporting a tool it watched get installed as missing. `audit-core.sh` used to **exempt** the Role repos from this helper on the reasoning that a role layer installs no packages; that was never true of an `--install` that does `pipx` and `go install` into `~/.local/bin`, which is why the prelude was hand-rolled here in the first place. The exemption is gone.
- **`sync-core.sh --help` printed `set -euo pipefail`.** The header is rendered with
  `sed -n '2,35p' "$0"`, and the comment block it means to print ends at line 33 — so
  every `--help` run trailed the closing `───` rule with the first two lines of actual
  code. Pre-existing, and found by the `--help` render check while retiring the
  `core_branch` fallback above; the range now stops at the rule.

- **Two more targets had the same guard defect, found by the new gate rather than by
  eye.** `make shellcheck` and `make secrets` each announced a skip and then ran the
  missing tool, exiting `127` — the same shape as `markdown` below, in targets nobody had
  thought to check. Both collapsed into one recipe line.
  `_core_make_gate_hits` (dotgibson/dotfiles-core#775) found them the first time it was
  pointed at this repo, having been written from the `markdown` case alone.

- **`make markdown` announced a skip and then ran anyway.** Each `make` recipe line runs
  in its own shell, so the guard's `exit 0` only ended that line: without `npx` it printed
  "npx not available — skipping markdown" and then ran `npx`, exiting `127`. Collapsed
  into one recipe line, so the skip is a real skip (dotgibson/dotfiles-core#775 — the same
  defect in six other fleet repos). `MD_FILES` was already correct here, including the
  `offensive/companion` exclude that matches the gate's, so only the guard needed fixing.
  An unreadable `MARKDOWNLINT_VERSION` now **fails** rather than silently linting
  unpinned — "same version as CI" is this target's whole claim.
- `.markdownlint.jsonc`'s header claimed this config was "the local check for the README"
  and that "CI here gates this repo's own code, not its Markdown". Both were true when
  written; dotgibson/dotfiles-core#592 made the markdown leg blocking and it covers all 17
  repo-owned files, not just the README.

- **Seven tools carried claims that were incomplete, imprecise, or absent** — the
  annotation half of [#275](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/275)
  (item 9). No package added or removed; the parsed set is byte-identical at 85 names.
  - **`httpx-toolkit`'s warning was right in conclusion, wrong in mechanism.** It said
    the "bare 'httpx' apt pkg is the python lib, not this". There is **no binary package
    named `httpx` at all** — `apt-cache show httpx` returns `E: No packages found`; the
    source package builds `python3-httpx`. So the bare name does not install the wrong
    tool, it **resolves to nothing** — which makes this an instance of the *hexyl* rule
    (a name this manifest must never carry), not of the package/binary split it was
    filed under. Currency added: apt runs about one minor behind.
  - **`wpscan` changed under you.** kali-rolling jumped **3.8.28 → 4.1.0** in Aug 2026
    after 3.8.28 sat since Mar 2025, so an `apt upgrade` since then swapped the tool,
    not the patch level. v4.0.0 requires **Ruby 3.3+**, **no longer scans plugins by
    default** (`-e ap`), moved config/cache to XDG dirs, and **removed**
    `--timthumbs-detection`, `--config-backups-detection`, `--db-exports-detection` and
    `--medias-detection`. Verified that nothing shipped breaks: `hacktheplanet` passes
    `--enumerate u,vp,vt` explicitly, so the plugin-default change never reaches it.
  - **`nikto` is alive and current, recorded so it is not re-suspected** (upstream
    pushed 2026-08-28; 2.6.1 released Jul 2026). It was flagged as a likely-stale
    "old Perl scanner" and is not. Its 2.6.x line does change the tool's **network
    signature** — a static Chrome User-Agent by default instead of one rotating per
    request — which is worth knowing when reasoning about what a defender saw.
  - **`snmpcheck` and `smtp-user-enum` were the enum block's last two unmarked
    freezes.** Both upstreams are frozen (nothink.org 1.9, 2015; pentestmonkey v1.2),
    and in both cases **apt is at that version, not behind it** — there is nothing to
    chase. Kept for the reason `mitm6` and `PrintSpoofer` are kept: SNMP community
    strings and SMTP `VRFY`/`EXPN` are protocol behaviours, not bugs anyone will patch
    out. Deliberately **no year** for `smtp-user-enum` — its page states no release
    date, so any date here would be invented.
  - **`bloodyad` ships BadSuccessor, which the README does not mention** (it is in the
    wiki: `add badSuccessor`, `msldap badsuccessor_check`, `msldap dmsas`), so the dMSA
    escalation path is already on the box. Annotated with the target-state caveat the
    `mitm6` note draws on the same axis: **Microsoft patched it 2025-08-12** (Server
    2025 DCs from build 26100.4946), and the post-patch variant needs a second
    primitive plus SharpSuccessor/Rubeus — neither of which this layer ships, and
    neither added.
  - **`PKINITtools` is going quiet** — not archived, but last push 2025-01-03, the
    stalest live pointer in the AD block. Dated note only. The note explicitly refuses
    to claim `certipy` supersedes it: that could not be confirmed from a primary source,
    and says so rather than leaving a plausible guess in the manifest.
  - **`GodPotato` was the last unmarked freeze in the target-dropped block** once
    `PrintSpoofer` got its ARCHIVED note. Static since 2023-11-24 and kept — the RPCSS
    OXID abuse survived the DCOM activation-hardening waves. `SigmaPotato` is named as
    the in-memory .NET fork but gets no pointer: itself untouched since 2024, so a
    mention rather than a successor.

- **`PACK` is in Kali apt, and the manifest sent you to a dead Python-2 repo instead.**
  The pointer read `→ UPSTREAM (github.com/iphelix/pack) … Python 2 era — run from the
  clone, no apt package`, and **both halves were wrong**. This is the fifth instance of
  the error class this file already records fixing for `caldera`, `name-that-hash`,
  `evilginx2` and `sliver`: a manifest that routes you upstream for something apt ships.
  Confirmed against apt's own index rather than a report — `pack`
  (`0.0.4+git20191128.fd779b2-0kali3`, arch `all`) `Depends: python3, python3-enchant`,
  and the package's **Homepage field is `github.com/Hydraze/pack`**, the maintained
  Python-3 fork (last push 2024-07-28). `iphelix`'s original is dead (last push
  2019-12-10). Now a plain apt line in Credential attacks. The membership rule does not
  block it the way it blocks `trufflehog` — `offensive/hacktheplanet:580` invokes
  `statsgen` and `maskgen` directly. The shipped binaries were read off the package
  rather than guessed: `statsgen`, `maskgen`, `policygen`, `rulegen` and **`dictstat`**,
  a fifth legacy binary the old note did not know about. The `kwp`-is-not-in-PACK note on
  the next line depends on this block naming `iphelix/pack` and is left intact.
  [#275](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/275) item 1.
- **`chisel` had no annotation at all, and apt ships a pre-release of it.** kali-rolling
  is `1.12.0~rc2-0kali1`; upstream cut **v1.12.0 final on 2026-08-29**, two RCs ahead —
  the opposite of the `ffuf` case, where apt trails a live upstream. 1.12.0 **breaks
  flags**: `--auth` now requires `<user>:<pass>` and *fails startup* on a missing colon,
  SOCKS5 users need an authfile entry matching `socks`, truncated MD5 fingerprints are
  rejected, and a client exhausting `--max-retry-count` exits non-zero. **Nothing shipped
  here breaks** — the `hacktheplanet` lines and the corpus' `reverse-tunnel-chisel` entry
  were checked and both use the bare `chisel server --reverse` form; the exposure is an
  operator adding `--auth` from memory. The `pspy` split is recorded too: apt's build is
  for your box, the static release binary is what you upload, and mixing is safe because
  the wire protocol is unchanged.
  [#275](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/275) item 2.
- **`kubectl` is outside Kubernetes' documented support skew, which the line did not
  say.** Its provenance note was correct; its silence on currency was the problem.
  kali-rolling is `1.33.4+ds-1` (imported 2025-10-02) against upstream stable **v1.37.0**.
  kubectl is supported within **±1 minor** of the apiserver, so a 1.33 client is
  unsupported against 1.35/1.36/1.37 — a documented window, not a version-number
  aesthetic, and it degrades the corpus' `k8s-*` entries sitting under `peirates`. The
  line now points at `pkgs.k8s.io` when a cluster's version matters, the same shape as
  the `google-cloud-cli`/`gh`/`vault` pointers in the same block.
  [#275](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/275) item 3.
- **The covert-egress header excepted `ptunnel-ng` as "the CURRENT upstream" — an
  annotation this changelog added two entries below, wrong within three weeks.** Its
  *version* claim holds (kali `1.43-2` is upstream v1.43); its *vitality* claim did not.
  v1.43's own release note says **"due to time constraints, there will be no further
  publications in the near future"** (tagged 2024-11-27) and master has not moved since
  2024-04-07. It froze at a version apt happens to have. **All five tools in that block
  are frozen, dead, or behind** — which is the honest state of covert-channel egress and
  more useful than implying one live option exists. ptunnel-ng is still the right choice
  of the two ptunnels; it is the maintained-*er* fork, not a live project.
  [#275](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/275) item 4.
- **`dnsenum`'s name lands you on the wrong repo.** The line carried no upstream pointer,
  and `fwaeytens/dnsenum` — what you find searching the name, 702 stars — has not moved
  since 2019-10-08. Kali ships `1.3.2-1`, whose Homepage names
  **`SparrowOchon/dnsenum2`** ("officially mainlined in Kali"). Same use-the-fork trap the
  `kwp`-vs-`iphelix/pack` and `ConfuserEx`-vs-`mkaring` notes exist to prevent — and the
  same shape as the `pack` fix above, where apt's Homepage also named a fork the note did
  not know about. Honest status: **frozen fork, and apt is on it**. `dnsrecon` is the
  maintained analogue and is in apt, but no doc or corpus entry names it, so it stays out
  on this file's membership rule.
  [#275](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/275) item 5.
- **`PowerUpSQL` was named in the payload-build block's "absent" list but was the one
  member of six with no status line.** Verified: not archived, but **no release has ever
  been cut** and the last functional commits are Aug 2024 — quiet, not dead, the `sRDI`
  shape. Recorded as **low impact here**, because the Linux-native half is already on the
  box: `impacket-mssqlclient` (`enum_links`/`use_link`) and `nxc mssql` cover
  linked-server hopping and are both already listed. `skahwah/SQLRecon` is named as the
  maintained analogue with no pointer of its own — the `pretender` treatment. The block's
  reference to that tool in `offensive/evasion` had also drifted, and is corrected from
  `:124` to `:126`.
  [#275](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/275) item 6.
- **`sliver`'s note ran one release ahead of the facts.** It said upstream "has kept
  releasing (past 1.7.6 by Aug 2026)"; **v1.7.6 shipped 2026-08-28 and is the head**, so
  "past" was wrong — now "through 1.7.6". The durable phrasing the last cycle introduced
  (check `sliver-server version` before an op, never a patch count) is unchanged and still
  right. What 1.7.6 contains sharpens it: it bounds mTLS/WireGuard envelope and pivot-frame
  allocation from the length prefix and fixes DNS varint boundary handling — memory
  exhaustion on network-facing paths, not cosmetic stability.
  [#275](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/275) item 7.
- **`proxychains4` carried no annotation, and the bare `proxychains` name is a live trap.**
  apt is at upstream's head (`4.17-3.1` = v4.17; rofl0r alive but slow to release — fixes
  landed 2026-08-27 against a 2024 tag). The addition is the trap: a real `proxychains`
  **package** exists in Kali and Debian sid at `3.1-9` — proxychains 3.1, from 2007. It
  escapes the usual `apt-file search '/usr/bin/proxychains$'` check because it ships
  **`/usr/bin/proxychains3`**, a third binary name, so `apt install proxychains` *succeeds*
  and silently hands you an 18-year-old tool. A sharper reason to name `proxychains4` than
  "the bare name is only a virtual `Provides:`".
  [#275](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/275) item 8.

- **`redup`'s katana step would have inherited the nuclei miscount on migration.** It ran
  `katana -update` unconditionally — the exact shape the nuclei engine step had before it
  was fixed below. katana `1.7.0-0kali1` landed in **kali-dev** on 2026-08-27 and has not
  migrated to kali-rolling; apt owning a binary is precisely when Kali patches its
  self-updater out, as it already did to nuclei. On the day katana migrates and is patched,
  the step would have started printing `✗ katana update failed` and tallying it on **every**
  run of a healthy box. The flag is now **probed** before use, reusing the nuclei step's
  whole-token regex byte-for-byte — the match has to be whole-token here too, since katana's
  help carries `-duc, -disable-update-check`, which a bare `grep -- -update` would match on
  exactly the patched build the probe exists to catch. A flagless build now degrades to a
  skip that tallies nothing. **Preventive: no behaviour change on today's `go install`
  build**, where the probe passes. `redup -h`, the redup header comment, `aliases.md` and
  `install/tools.lst` all gave nuclei a build hedge and katana none; all four now match.
  [#260](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/260) item 5.
- **The Cloud / SaaS / CI-CD block claimed Terraform Cloud entries are "pure REST —
  curl + a token, nothing to install."** The `tfc-agent` entry lower in the same file already
  said the opposite — that it "corrects this file's older claim that the Terraform Cloud
  entries are pure REST" — so the correction was written at one end and never applied at
  the other, leaving the two halves of one file contradicting each other.
  `tfc-agent-hijack` creates the agent pool over REST and then **runs `tfc-agent`**, a
  HashiCorp release binary on infrastructure you control; only `tfc-token-backdoor` and
  `tfc-var-injection` are curl-only. Checking the rest of the sentence while correcting it
  found it loose for two more of the five services it named: Snowflake's three entries are
  **SQL** (```sql fences, which is why the corpus gate never sees a command in them) and
  `slack-2fa-disable` is a console toggle with **no command at all**. "Nothing to install"
  still holds for both — "curl + a token" did not. Okta and GitLab were accurate as
  claimed.
- **katana's manifest pointer said "not in apt", which is no longer true.** Initial Kali
  packaging (`1.7.0-0kali1`) was committed to **kali-dev** on 2026-08-27. It has not
  migrated, so `go install` is still the only route on any box today — but the pointer now
  states the kali-dev version and the "has not migrated" qualifier, mirroring the shape
  `rustscan` already carries in the same file, and names `pkg.kali.org/pkg/katana` as the
  re-check. It also records what a migration would bring: the kali-dev packaging carries no
  `debian/patches` directory yet, so `-update` survives there for now.
  [#260](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/260) item 5.
- **`mitm6`'s freeze note claimed "there is no maintained successor to move to."** Too
  strong, and the near-miss has a name: RedTeamPentesting's `pretender` (Go, v1.4.1, Jul
  2026) is maintained and does mitm6's exact DHCPv6/DNS takeover plus mDNS/LLMNR/NBT-NS.
  But it is a **spoofer only** — no listener, no capture, no relay — so it replaces neither
  `mitm6` nor `responder`, and the note's conclusion (keep mitm6, frozen because finished)
  is unchanged. It gets no `→ UPSTREAM` pointer of its own: no doc and no corpus entry
  invokes it. The same note now records a second axis the old text conflated with it —
  whether the coercion **fires** is not whether the relay **yields**. On fully-patched
  Server 2025 / Win11 24H2, SMB signing is required by default and LDAP channel binding
  ships Enabled-When-Supported (MSRC, Dec 2024): the trigger still fires, the SMB and
  plain-LDAP relay legs close, and value shifts toward `krbrelayx` and the AD CS / PKINIT
  path. [#260](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/260) item 6.
- **`redup` counted every successful `searchsploit -u` as a failure.** The step ran
  `if searchsploit -u; then …`, but searchsploit exits **6**, not 0, after any
  successful update — its own header documents it ("Exit code '6' means updated
  packages (APT, brew or Git)") and its update routine ends in a bare `exit 6` on
  every route (apt, brew and git alike). So a completely successful refresh printed
  `✗ searchsploit -u failed` and was tallied, making the summary read red on a healthy
  box. This is the **same miscount** as the nuclei engine step below, one step further
  down the same function, and it survived that fix. The exit status is now captured
  and both 0 and 6 count as success; anything else still reports, and now prints the
  code. Found while correcting the step's prose for
  [#260](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/260) item 8 — the report
  called this a comment-only fix.
- **`redup`'s searchsploit comment described a code path that does not run on Kali.**
  It explained the `sudo` escalation as a permissions problem on a root-owned git
  checkout under `/usr/share/exploitdb`. On a deb install `searchsploit -u` never
  reaches its `git pull`: it probes `apt-cache search "^exploitdb$"` first and, on a
  hit, runs `sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install exploitdb`, escalating on its own.
  The writability probe is kept — it is still correct for a user-local or `/opt`
  checkout and on non-Kali — but it is now documented as inert on the deb route. The
  consequence strengthens the never-mid-engagement warning rather than softening it:
  the step can move **apt state**, not just refresh a data directory.
- **Five more annotations routed you around a package apt already ships** — the same
  error class as caldera below, found by re-verifying every `→ UPSTREAM` name in the
  manifest against apt rather than by any report. None of the five appears in
  [#260](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/260):
  - `evilginx2` was annotated `→ UPSTREAM (go install or release binary)` **and** filed
    under the block headed "Operator-side tooling, **not in apt**", whose preamble says
    outright that these "have no Kali package". kali-rolling ships `evilginx2`
    (`3.3.0+ds1-0kali1`), which *is* upstream's latest release (v3.3.0, Apr 2024). Now a
    plain apt line in Credential attacks, ROE warning intact.
  - `name-that-hash` was annotated `→ UPSTREAM (pip install name-that-hash)`. Kali ships
    it (`1.11.0-0kali1`). The decision to leave it uninstalled stands on its own merits;
    only the packaging pointer was wrong.
  - `pspy` was annotated `→ UPSTREAM (release binary)` in a block whose premise is
    "per-engagement downloads rather than apt packages". Kali ships `pspy`
    (`1.2.1-0kali1`). Here the conclusion survives for a **sharper** reason than the
    block gave: what apt ships is a host-arch, dynamically-linked Debian Go build
    (`Depends: libc6`), while what you upload to a target is upstream's *static*
    pspy32/pspy64. So the release binary really is the per-engagement download — just
    not because "there is no package".
  - `PowerUp.ps1` was annotated `→ UPSTREAM (PowerSploit …)`. Kali packages it: the
    `powersploit` package (`3.0.0+git20200817-0kali1`) drops the script at
    `/usr/share/windows-resources/powersploit/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1` — the **same pattern
    as `mimikatz`**, a Linux package whose payload is Windows content you copy to the
    target. It is pulled in by `kali-linux-headless`, so it is already present on a
    default box. Still not an apt line of its own, but "fetch it from GitHub" was wrong.
  - The evasion payload-build paragraph asserted "**None is in Kali apt**" of its five
    tools. `donut` is packaged (`1.1-0kali3+b1`, `/usr/bin/donut`) and is the one member
    whose generator runs natively on **Linux**, so the paragraph's "all run operator-side
    on WINDOWS" was wrong about it too. It stays unlisted as a judgement, not because apt
    cannot supply it. `macro_pack`, `PowerUpSQL`, `sRDI`, `ConfuserEx` and `ScareCrow`
    are genuinely absent, as claimed.
- **`caldera` is in `kali-linux-large`.** The note added with the caldera fix below
  claimed it is "in NO `kali-linux-*` metapackage"; `apt-cache rdepends caldera` says
  otherwise. It is absent from `kali-linux-default`, which is what the line was
  reaching for, so the conclusion (a default box needs this line) is unchanged.
- **`redup`'s nuclei engine step could never succeed on Kali.** It ran
  `nuclei -update` unconditionally, but Kali patches that flag out of its packaged
  nuclei — apt owns the binary, so self-updating it is not nuclei's job there. Kali's
  `-h` UPDATE section carries only `-update-templates`, `-update-template-dir` and
  `-disable-update-check`. So the step failed on **every** run on the primary target
  platform and tallied a failure, making the summary read red on a completely healthy
  box — the exact miscount the function's own comments exist to prevent. The engine step
  is now probed and the templates step (the daily-moving half) stays unconditional, so a
  `go install`-provided nuclei on non-Kali Debian still self-updates. The probe matches
  `-update`/`-up` as a whole TOKEN: a bare substring grep matches `-update-templates`,
  `-update-template-dir` and `-disable-update-check`, three hits on the very help text
  that proves the flag is absent.
- **Three apt names in `install/offensive-packages.txt` resolved against nothing.**
  Verified against kali-rolling's own binary index, not a local box:
  - `bbot` is packaged in **no** Kali component and never has been (pkg.kali.org 404s) —
    now an UPSTREAM/pipx comment. The old line's "(pipx/upstream if the repo build lags)"
    hedge implied a repo build that does not exist.
  - `snmp-check` is the **binary** name; the package is `snmpcheck`, which ships
    `/usr/bin/snmp-check`. Same package/binary split the file already documents for
    `httpx-toolkit` and `python3-ldapdomaindump`. `hacktheplanet`'s command was always
    right; only the manifest was wrong.
  - `rustscan` is absent from main, contrib and non-free alike — Kali's packaging sits in
    kali-**dev** at 2.4.1 and has not migrated. The line also claimed it "ships in
    kali-linux-default", whose `Depends` does not name it, so both halves were wrong. Now
    an UPSTREAM (cargo) comment.
  `test/check-packages.sh` had been reporting all three for weeks; see the `packages.yml`
  note under Changed for why nobody saw it.
- **Caldera was routed to Docker for nothing.** `install/offensive-packages.txt` carried
  it as `→ UPSTREAM/docker` and `offensive/offensive.zsh` justified the missing probe with
  "Caldera ships no `caldera` binary". Both false: kali-rolling ships `caldera`
  (5.3.0-0kali1) and it installs `/usr/bin/caldera`. Now a plain apt line, noting the
  ~70 MB Python chain and that no `kali-linux-*` metapackage carries it. The decision not
  to add `HAVE_CALDERA` stands, but for the real reason — nothing in `offensive.zsh`
  invokes it, which is `install/tools.lst`'s actual membership rule.
- **The corpus-coverage counts went stale again**, exactly as recorded below for the
  v2.10.0 sync. A later v2.10.1 sync added `entries/blue/smb-enum-5145.md` and projected
  the `smb-enum` pair into both views; no header moved. The version notes in those files
  now point at `companion.lock` for the exact revision instead of hardcoding a commit
  count, which rots the same way the counts do. Actual is **103 red / 102 blue**
  with **19** and **24** blocks projected. Fixed in `hacktheplanet`, `PURPLE-TEAM.md`,
  `OFFENSIVE-METHODOLOGY.md` and — found while verifying, reported by neither audit —
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the `Makefile`. `hacktheplanet` also listed `smb-enum-nxc` among
  the entries "covered as richer prose below" while generating a block for it seven
  paragraphs later, so its own accounting summed to 102 rather than 103.
- **`CLAUDE.md` described `--install` as apt-only on Kali.** `_install_apt_absent`
  pipx-installs ROADtools on **both** routes, which `bootstrap.sh` and
  `install/offensive-packages.txt` both state plainly. "Where things are" also documented
  2 of the 4 `install/` manifests; `corpus-commands.lst` and `impacket-binaries.lst` are
  now listed, the latter being the file whose entire purpose is making
  `impacket-petitpotam` fail (#208).
- **`OFFENSIVE-METHODOLOGY.md` dated Caldera's Apache move to "May 2026"**, contradicting
  the manifest's already-corrected 2025-12-19 donation date (#211 landed that fix in the
  manifest only).
- **`hacktheplanet`'s escalation-primitives index restated `certipy-ad find … -vulnerable`
  without `-stdout`**, so a copy-paste wrote to a file instead of the terminal. The
  canonical AD CS section and the corpus entry both carry the flag.

- **The corpus-coverage counts were stale in three files** (found while verifying #212,
  which had reported them as correct). `hacktheplanet` and `PURPLE-TEAM.md` claimed 92 red /
  90 blue entries; the htpx **v2.10.0** sync added 11 of each and the headers were never
  updated — actual is **103 red / 101 blue**. The decomposition went stale with them: the
  cloud/SaaS/CI-CD bucket is 56 (not ~55), C2-egress/Impact is 13 (not ~12), and **7 Linux
  persistence/privesc/credential-access entries had no bucket at all**.
- **Two red entries and their blue pairs are projected nowhere and belong to no category.**
  `bloodhound-collect` and `ldap-recon` are both `Active Directory — discovery`, squarely
  inside the "richer prose here" subject area but absent from its list; their pairs
  `bloodhound-collect-4662` / `ldap-recon-4662` key off event 4662, which is
  `PURPLE-TEAM.md`'s own criterion for projecting. `hacktheplanet`'s claim that an
  unprojected entry is "not a gap in the generator" was therefore false. Both files now name
  the gap instead of implying it cannot exist.
- **`rdp-hijack-tscon` was listed as "covered better below"; it is covered *equally*.** Its
  two commands are byte-identical to the prose ones. Noted rather than silently kept.
- `OFFENSIVE-METHODOLOGY.md`'s "roughly two-thirds of the corpus" replaced with the measured
  figure — 69/103 red (67%) and 76/101 blue (75%).

All three files now carry the same caveat: these counts are hand-maintained, they go stale
on every `companion-sync`, and the corpus is authoritative when they disagree.

- **`kwp` was attributed to the wrong project** (#213). The manifest filed it under
  `PACK (kwp, statsgen, maskgen) → github.com/iphelix/pack`. PACK ships
  statsgen/maskgen/policygen/rulegen and no `kwp` — `kwp` is hashcat's kwprocessor, and
  `hacktheplanet`'s invocation is verbatim kwprocessor. Following the old pointer landed you
  in a repo that does not contain the tool. Split onto its own UPSTREAM line.
- **`exploitdev`'s Linux toolchain was unmanifested** (#212, #213). `gdb`, `nasm` and
  `objdump` are invoked by that reference and appeared nowhere in the package list. Resolved
  by checking a real kali-rolling box rather than guessing: `nasm` (via metasploit-framework)
  and `binutils` are already pulled transitively, so they go in the accounting block, while
  **`gdb` is genuinely absent** — gcc only *suggests* it — so it joins the "Kali does NOT
  ship by default" block, whose stated test it meets exactly.
- **`nc` was named only inside another package's comment** (#212). netcat is the primary
  command of the reverse-shell fold and was listed nowhere. Added as
  **`netcat-traditional`**, not `netcat-openbsd` as the audit suggested: Kali installs
  traditional and points the `nc` alternative at it, and the documented `nc -lvnp` form is a
  traditional idiom — OpenBSD's nc rejects `-p` alongside `-l`, so that variant could have
  flipped the alternative and broken the very line it was meant to support.

- **Four field-reference commands could not run as written** (#213, #212).
  `hacktheplanet` invoked `nmap --script=msrpc-dcom-interface-activation`, which is not a
  script nmap ships — verified against nmap 7.99 on kali-rolling, where the only msrpc NSE
  is `msrpc-enum` (already the line directly above). Dropped rather than replaced: there is
  nothing to replace it with. `exploitdev` invoked `!mona egghunter`, which is not a mona
  command — `egg` is, and `-c` (NtAccessCheckAndAuditAlarm) is one of *its* options; the two
  lines collapse into one. `hacktheplanet` also credited `--dc` to impacket/certipy when it
  is kerbrute's idiom — impacket and certipy use `-dc-ip`, as every impacket line in that
  file already does. The same misattribution in this file's #187 entry is corrected with it.
- **`exploitdev` presented `hexyl` as installed when no fleet layer ships it.** The note
  claimed it was "Kali-only in this stack (not in Core)"; it is in Core, Kali apt (no such
  package exists) and `install/offensive-packages.txt` alike — nowhere. `offensive.zsh`
  probes `HAVE_HEXYL` but nothing installs it, so the bad-char *verification* step silently
  needed a tool the operator did not have. Now says so, with an `xxd` fallback, and points
  at the dotfiles-core#395 deferral.

- **Two `hacktheplanet` commands could not run as written** (#187). `rusthound-ce` was
  invoked with `--dc <ip_address>`; RustHound-CE has no such flag — that is kerbrute's
  idiom (impacket/certipy use `-dc-ip`) — and takes `-i/--ldapip` for the DC IP or `-f/--ldapfqdn` for its
  FQDN. And two pivot lines invoked bare `proxychains`, which is **not a binary on this
  layer's own box**: the manifest ships `proxychains4`, that package installs only
  `/usr/bin/proxychains4`, and its `Provides: proxychains` is a virtual-package relation, so
  `apt-file search '/usr/bin/proxychains$'` matches nothing. The audit that filed this
  guessed the second one was "probably fine … one `command -v` settles it"; it was run, and
  it isn't. Both lines now carry the reasoning inline, since `--dc` **is** right for
  `kerbrute` two folds up and the next reader will otherwise "fix" it back.

- **`cifs-utils` was missing from the manifest** (#187). `hacktheplanet` mounts a share with
  `mount -t cifs` twice — once in the SMB fold, once on SYSVOL inside the GPP-cpassword
  block — and nothing in `offensive-packages.txt` provided `mount.cifs`. `smbclient`
  *browses* a share; mounting one is a separate package. This was the only real gap of the
  six the audit alleged: `samba-common-bin` and `gcc-mingw-w64-i686` were false (`smbclient`
  ships `/usr/bin/rpcclient`; `mingw-w64` provides `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc`), and the rest had
  already landed with #186.

- **The manifest's own accounting claim was false again** (#187). The target-dropped block
  claims it "accounts for every tool the DOCS *and* the COMPANION CORPUS name", and seven
  doc-named tools were unaccounted for. `pspy` joins the block properly — it is genuinely
  target-dropped, and `ippsec` names it in the same breath as linpeas. The other six
  (`macro_pack`, `PowerUpSQL`, and the `Donut`/`sRDI`/`ConfuserEx`/`ScareCrow` loaders from
  `evasion`) get a **stated exclusion** instead of a listing, because they are operator-side
  *payload-build* tooling that runs on Windows: not target-dropped, not in Kali apt, and not
  something a Linux apt list should imply it can install. Either a tool is listed or the
  manifest says in one line why it isn't — which is what makes the claim checkable.

- **`ldapdomaindump` was installed twice and invoked never** (#187). It arrives by apt
  (`python3-ldapdomaindump`) *and* by pipx on the non-Kali route, and `OFFENSIVE-METHODOLOGY.md`
  lists it — but no command anywhere under `offensive/` ran it, making it the only installed
  AD-enum tool with no copy-paste line. It now has one in the AD fold, writing to `loot/ldd`
  to match the methodology table. The manifest records the apt-name/binary-name split, the
  same dual-name trap already documented for impacket and certipy.

  Not acted on from #187: the `bloodhound-python` finding was **already fixed** at HEAD (the
  audit ran against a pre-`b294258` tree — every line number in it is stale by 11–15, and it
  cites `os/kali.conf`, deleted 2026-08-18). The `-M wmi-event` finding is real but worse
  than filed — that NetExec module does not exist in *either* spelling — and lives in
  generated content, so it was fixed upstream in htpx#73 and arrives here on the next
  companion sync.

- **Seven packages, behind eight commands `hacktheplanet` invokes, had no manifest line**
  (#186) — `ftp`, `showmount`, `dig`, `nslookup`, `mysql`, `psql`, `redis-cli` and
  `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc`. The Service-enumeration block states its own rule — *every fold's
  primary command in PATH* — and five folds were not honouring it. `ftp`, `nfs-common` and
  `bind9-dnsutils` join that block; the other four get a **new block of their own**, because
  checking `kali-meta`'s `debian/control` showed the audit's framing was too generous: no
  Kali metapackage names `mariadb-client`, `postgresql-client`, `redis-tools` or
  `mingw-w64`, so those four lines in `hacktheplanet` fail on a **stock** box, not just a
  slim one. `mingw-w64` is the sharpest — `build-essential` gives you native `gcc` only, so
  nothing else on the box covers the cross-compile.
  - Note the DNS name: it is **`bind9-dnsutils`**, not the `dnsutils` the audit proposed.
    `dnsutils` is a transitional binary off the same `bind9` source, gone from trixie and
    back only in sid; the sole Kali metapackage still naming it is `kali-linux-wsl`. Since
    `test/check-packages.sh` resolves every name against kali-rolling, the durable name is
    the only safe one to pin.
  - No `install/tools.lst` change: that file's header restricts it to commands
    `offensive/offensive.zsh` probes or invokes by bare name, and none of these are.
    Adding them would make bootstrap's report cry wolf.
- **`gcc-multilib` was the eighth package, spotted during that pass and deferred** (#186).
  `hacktheplanet:212` runs `gcc -m32` two lines below the `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc` line above,
  and fails for the identical reason: `build-essential`'s `gcc` is native x86-64 with no
  32-bit libs, so rebuilding an old PoC dies on `<bits/libc-header-start.h>`. No Kali
  metapackage names it either, so it joins the *does-not-ship-by-default* block rather than
  the slim-install one.
- **`PrintSpoofer64.exe` and `GodPotato` were the target-dropped block's one blind spot**
  (#186). That block promises to account for *every* tool the docs **and** the corpus name;
  these two arrive from the corpus inside `hacktheplanet`'s `companion:gen
  potato-seimpersonate` block, which is how they slipped it. Two `UPSTREAM →` lines now,
  matching the linpeas/winPEAS treatment.
- **`redup`'s help advertised a step that always no-ops** (#186). Both help strings and
  `aliases.md` promised a refresh of "the go-installed tools", but `go_fast_movers` has
  been `()` since kerbrute was dropped as upstream-frozen. The strings now describe what
  the function does; the block comment still records why the array is empty and how to
  re-populate it. `aliases.md` also gains `katana`, which it had missed since redup started
  driving it.
- **`doggo`, `carapace` and `sesh` never installed on a fresh box.** `mise` lands in
  `~/.local/bin`, which is not on `PATH` during bootstrap, so the `go install`
  fallback's `command -v mise` always missed. A PATH prelude fixes this and the
  related re-install-every-run behaviour of `atuin`.
- **A symlink cycle in the `.zshrc` wiring.** `bootstrap.sh` re-did a link the
  library already makes, bypassing the ELOOP guard in `_blib_seed_zdotdir_rc`.
- **`bootstrap.sh` no longer silently installs nothing** when
  `install/packages.txt` is missing.
- `apt_install`'s per-package retry keeps `--no-install-recommends`.
- The `bootstrap` workflow's path filter omitted `install/**` and `wsl/**`, so
  package-list edits never re-ran the bootstrap test. Filters removed.
- `dotsync` hardcoded `~/dotfiles-Offense`; it now resolves this checkout.
- The offensive tmux binding shipped even when its script was not linked, and
  hardcoded `~/.config` against an XDG-aware bootstrap.
- `@batt_enable` was unconditionally off "because WSL has no battery" — now
  detected, so bare-metal laptops keep the widget.
- `ssh/config` pinned modern-only crypto on `Host *`, which refuses to negotiate
  with the legacy targets an offensive box exists to reach. Scoped to your own
  infrastructure.
- `pseudo-shell.py` proxied through Burp by default, so every request failed
  opaquely when Burp was not running; now opt-in. Its `requests` dependency
  documents a PEP 668-compatible install path.
- `redup` printed "go not installed" for an intentionally empty tool list, and ran
  `searchsploit -u` without the privilege its root-owned checkout needs.

### Added

- **`core-verify` asks the integrity question again, and `core-check` gets the freshness
  one back (dotgibson/dotfiles-core#691).** Adopting the fleet vocabulary pointed the
  canonical `core-verify` at `test/check-core-freshness.sh` and demoted `core-check` to an
  alias of it. Those are two different questions: freshness is *is there a NEWER Core
  upstream?*, integrity is *is THIS `core/` the tree `core.lock` pins?* — and Core's
  `scripts/make-vocabulary.txt` defines the canonical verb as the second. So the register
  read green on a target answering something else, while this repo still had **no local
  integrity check at all**: `core-integrity.yml` ran one in CI and nothing ran one here.
  `core-check` is a real target again, with help text naming its question, and
  `core-verify` delegates to Core's own `scripts/core-integrity.sh` from a `CORE_REPO`
  checkout — the same invocation CI uses, and the only implementation that knows how the
  fan-out filters the vendored subtree. Verified both ways against a sibling clone at core
  v6.1.0: `core-verify` reports `pristine`, `core-check` reports `current`.

- **Three tool decisions recorded so the next scout cycle doesn't re-raise them.** All
  three were proposed by [#260](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-Offense/issues/260)
  and all three were declined, on stated grounds rather than by omission:
  - **`gh` in `redup`'s `go_fast_movers`** (item 9). It has the profile the machinery was
    kept for — go-only, apt-absent since kali-rolling dropped 2.46.0-3 on 2025-12-10, and
    genuinely fast — but upstream supports the release binary and GitHub's own apt repo,
    **not `go install`**, and a bare `go install` build reports an unset/dev version
    string. The entry would replace a correct build with one that cannot report its own
    version. Recorded in the comment beside the katana rejection already there, so the
    array is now empty for **two** stated reasons rather than one.
  - **`trufflehog`.** In kali apt (`3.94.3-0kali1`) and a good fit for what the Cloud /
    SaaS / CI-CD block is for — "find the leaked key" is the missing first step of most of
    the `gh-*`/`npm-*`/`pypi-*` supply-chain entries. Held out on this file's own
    membership rule, not on merit: no doc and no corpus entry invokes it. The doc edit is
    the prerequisite; the note says so, and says it becomes a plain apt line once one does.
  - **`PrivescCheck`** — same rule, same note, beside the `PowerUp.ps1` entry it would
    complement. The report conceded the prerequisite for this one and not for `trufflehog`;
    the rule applies to both identically.

- **`make view-counts` / `test/check-view-counts.sh`** — a gate on the hand-typed corpus
  counts in `hacktheplanet`, `PURPLE-TEAM.md` and `OFFENSIVE-METHODOLOGY.md`. Two of those
  files already carried a caveat saying the numbers go stale on every `companion-sync`;
  this executes it. It exists because the drift above is a **repeat** — the same fix is
  recorded for the v2.10.0 sync — and nothing could see it: `gen-views.sh --check`
  byte-compares block *contents* and has no opinion on how many blocks exist, and
  markdownlint cannot tell `101` from `102`. It is repo-owned rather than an extension of
  `gen-views.sh` because `offensive/companion/` is a vendored subtree and an edit there is
  lost on the next sync. It checks only what is mechanically derivable (entry totals,
  projected-block counts, and the sums of those); the semantic buckets — 56 cloud/SaaS/
  CI-CD, 13 C2-egress/Impact, 7 Linux, 69/76, the percentages — are deliberately ungated,
  because nothing in `entries/*.md` marks an entry "cloud". Exit 2 means a stale count;
  exit 1 means an anchored sentence was rewritten and needs re-anchoring — two different
  failures, so a maintainer is never told the wrong one.

- **The SMB enum fold and its detection are now entry-backed.** `companion.lock`
  bumps to htpx `b80741f`, which pairs `smb-enum-nxc` with a new `smb-enum-5145` blue
  entry ([htpx#97](https://github.com/dotgibson/htpx/issues/97)), and both sides are
  wrapped in `companion:gen` markers: the nxc commands in `hacktheplanet`'s SMB fold,
  and the detection in `PURPLE-TEAM.md`'s recon section.

  The hacktheplanet block is the notable half. Those five `nxc smb` lines have been
  hand-written since the file existed, and the entry upstream carried only three of them
  — so wrapping them would have silently deleted `--loggedon-users` and the `/24` spray.
  htpx#100 widened the entry to the full fold with its inline comments matched, which
  makes `render_red` reproduce the existing lines **byte for byte**: the diff to
  `hacktheplanet` here is the two marker lines and nothing else. That is the bar for
  putting a marker around prose that was already good — the tempting shortcut, wrap it
  and let the generator win, loses content nobody notices for months.

  This sync also brings `pair_note:`
  ([htpx#98](https://github.com/dotgibson/htpx/pull/98)), which the vendored copy
  predated: an entry carrying `pair: null` must now say why, and upstream CI rejects one
  that does not.

- **ROADtools is now installed by `--install`, on every route** (#231). Entra/M365
  tooling in this layer was entirely Windows-side (AADInternals, TeamFiltration,
  MSOLSpray); the corpus even cited dirkjanm's ROADtools as `device-code-phish`'s
  `source:` while handing you Windows-only PowerShell. `bootstrap.sh` grew an
  `_install_apt_absent` step — a THIRD install category for tools no route can
  apt-install — that pipx-installs `roadrecon` and `roadtx` on the Kali path too, not
  just the portable subset, so the Entra corpus entries finally run from the attacker
  box. `hacktheplanet`'s M365 fold documents the Linux commands and
  `install/offensive-packages.txt` carries the annotation. The corpus entry's own
  `platform:`/`source:` fix lands upstream in dotgibson/htpx.

- **SCCM/MECM is now covered — it was a total blank** (#230). `grep -ri sccm` over the
  repo used to return nothing, despite site-server takeover and Network Access Account
  extraction being mainstream AD attack surface. Added a `SCCM / MECM` fold to
  `hacktheplanet` (discovery -> NAA over the network or from a compromised client -> site
  takeover -> PXE boot-media creds), a `Cred access` row in the methodology map, and
  `sccmhunter` + `pxethiefy` UPSTREAM annotations in `install/offensive-packages.txt`
  (whose corpus-only block widened to admit doc-named operator tooling). sccmhunter is
  documented, not wired into `--install`: it is not on PyPI, its git install carries a
  Python 3.13 floor and an ldap3 fork pin pip drops silently, so a documented manual step
  beats a best-effort loop that fails quietly. Every command verified against upstream.

- **`corpus commands resolve` — a gate for the question nothing asked** (#208). Two entries
  in `coerce-petitpotam` once invoked `impacket-petitpotam` and `dfscoerce`. Neither is a
  real command, both shipped in a released corpus, and a **human reading the file** found
  them — because every existing gate looks somewhere else: `gen-views.sh --check`
  byte-compares the 18 *projected* red blocks (85 of 103 are unprojected), `check-packages.sh`
  reads the manifest and never the corpus, `companion-integrity` checks provenance rather
  than content, and htpx's own CI checks pairing and slots rather than existence.
  `test/check-corpus-commands.sh` resolves the first token of every command line in every
  red entry against the manifest, an `impacket-binaries.lst` roster, and the classifications
  in `install/corpus-commands.lst`. Offline and deterministic, so unlike `packages-check` it
  can be **required**; wired into `make test` and its own workflow.
  - Its `--self-test` rebuilds the pre-v2.8.0 `coerce-petitpotam` at run time and asserts
    the gate still reddens on it — a regression guard for the gate itself, since one that
    quietly stopped catching its own motivating bug would pass forever.
  - `install/corpus-commands.lst` requires a line of prose on every classification, so
    "whatever the allowlist excuses, it says so" is enforced rather than hoped for. It also
    fails on a classification no entry uses any more, so a `companion-sync` that drops an
    entry surfaces its dead excuse.
  - The roster spans **two** packages: `impacket-scripts` (57 wrappers) and
    `python3-impacket` (5 more, including `impacket-secretsdump` and `impacket-wmiexec`).
    A roster built from `impacket-scripts` alone would have failed the two most-used
    commands in the corpus. `packages.yml` gained an advisory step that re-derives it from
    kali-rolling and diffs, so the checked-in copy cannot rot unnoticed.
- **Five tools the corpus invokes and nothing accounted for**, all surfaced by the new gate
  on its first run: `ldap-utils` (`ldapsearch`, a real apt package, now installed), plus
  UPSTREAM entries for `evilginx2`, `MSOLSpray` and `tfc-agent` in a new
  "Corpus-only operator tooling" block. `tfc-agent` also corrects this file's older claim
  that the Terraform Cloud entries are pure REST. The legacy `bloodhound-python` binary is
  now named in the BloodHound block, with the warning that the entry invoking it is wrong
  for a CE stack — that fix routes upstream to htpx.

- **A gate against leaked `RETURN` traps** (#198) — `test/check-return-traps.sh`, wired
  into `make lint` as `make trap-guard` and into CI as the `return-traps` job in
  `checks.yml`. A bash RETURN trap is a **global slot, not a function-scoped one**: armed
  inside a function it survives into the *caller's* frame and fires a second time when the
  caller returns, where the local it cleans up is out of scope and `set -u` makes that
  fatal. In `dotfiles-Debian` that aborted `provision()` after every package had installed
  but before `wire_links` ran — the whole stack on the box, and not one symlink. Nothing
  else can see it: the broken line is valid bash, so shellcheck and `bash -n` both pass it,
  and no CI job in this fleet exercises a real install path (every bootstrap run is
  `--links-only`). Hence a grep. The correct form is
  `trap 'trap - RETURN; rm -rf "$tmp"' RETURN`.

  **This is prevention, not a fix.** #198 reported the bug in this repo's
  `verified_install()`, but that function — and the entire SHA-pinned out-of-band install
  block around it — left in the layer split (`6d641d2`), which moved it to
  `dotfiles-Debian`; the trap went with it. No repo-owned shell here arms a RETURN trap
  today. The guard exists so none ever does again. zsh is out of scope: it has no `RETURN`
  signal at all.

- `Makefile` — the entry point (`make lint`, `test`, `core-sync`, `packages-check`, …).
  Makes `core.lock`'s `make core-lock` instruction true for the first time.
- `scripts/sync-core.sh`, `test/check-core-freshness.sh` and a `freshness` workflow —
  the consumer-side core-sync line, which three files already referenced and none
  provided.
- `test/check-companion-integrity.sh` — tamper detection for the second vendored
  subtree, mirroring `core-integrity`.
- `test/check-packages.sh` + a `packages` workflow resolving every manifest name
  against `kali-rolling`.
- markdownlint in CI, against the `.markdownlint.jsonc` that had been sitting
  unused.
- `SECURITY.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, issue and PR templates, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `.shellcheckrc`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`.
- `bootstrap.sh --dry-run` and `--no-upgrade`.
- `companion_version` / `companion_tag` in `companion.lock`, for symmetry with
  `core.lock`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING — `make core-sync` no longer pulls; Core arrives by fan-out
  ([dotfiles-core#676](https://github.com/dotgibson/dotfiles-core/issues/676)).**
  `scripts/sync-core.sh` is now report-only: it says how far behind `core/` is and how
  Core actually gets here, and writes nothing.

  This repo was the fleet's **one sanctioned second writer** into `core/`. That sanction
  rested on a specific property, spelled out in `VENDORING.md`: the pull stamped
  `core.lock` from *what it actually pulled* — `core_sha` from the squash commit's
  `git-subtree-split` trailer, `core_version` from the tree on disk — so the lock could
  not describe a commit its own `core/` did not contain.

  A filtered vendor removes exactly that property. Core stopped vendoring its whole tree:
  `core/` is now `core.manifest` ∪ `core.vendor`, roughly two thirds of it. A
  `git subtree pull` **merges the whole upstream tree** and has no way to apply that
  filter, so "what it actually pulled" is by construction no longer what a vendored
  `core/` should contain. The first pull after this repo's lock moved to a filtering
  commit would land every upstream file against an expectation of the subset, and
  `core-integrity` would report `TAMPERED` — correctly, with no hand-edit anywhere.

  Teaching it to filter was the alternative and is worse: it would make this repo a second
  **producer** of Core's format, which the sanction never extended to. Two implementations
  of one filter is the failure dotfiles-core#556 exists to prevent.

  **In practice this changes nothing about how Core actually arrives.** Every one of the
  last ten `core.lock` writes in this repo came from the fan-out, not from `make
  core-sync`. The independent cadence being given up was already not in use.

  `make core-sync` and `make core-lock` survive as the place that explains this — they are
  what someone types when asking "how do I move Core?", and that question still has an
  answer. `--check` is accepted and ignored, since every run is now what it meant.

- **`offensive/companion/` is unaffected and still pulls.** htpx vendors its whole tree
  and has no allowlist, so `make companion-sync` keeps working exactly as before. The
  asymmetry between the two subtrees is deliberate and is now stated in `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md` and the `Makefile` header — do not "fix" `companion-sync` to match.

- **`ptunnel-ng` added beside `ptunnel`, not instead of it.** `ptunnel-ng`
  (`utoni/ptunnel-ng`, redirected from `lnslbrty`) is the maintained fork and kali's
  `1.43-2` *is* its latest upstream release, so it is the one to reach for. The original
  `ptunnel` line stays for one mechanical reason: the corpus entry
  `entries/red/icmp-tunnel-c2.md` invokes the bare `ptunnel` binary, and
  `test/check-corpus-commands.sh` — offline and **required** — resolves that name against
  the manifest, so dropping the line reds a blocking gate. `ptunnel-ng` cannot cover for
  it either: it ships only `/usr/bin/ptunnel-ng`, with no `ptunnel` binary and no
  alternatives symlink. Retargeting the entry is an upstream change in
  [htpx](https://github.com/dotgibson/htpx) — `entries/` is a vendored subtree — and it
  is a **rewrite, not a rename**: the two are not flag-compatible, `-lp/-da/-dp` having
  become `-l/-r/-R`.
- **The covert-egress block now carries a status per tool.** It read as though all four
  were current upstreams; not one is. `iodine` is a full release behind (kali `0.7.0-13`
  vs upstream `v0.8.0`); `dnscat2` is frozen at its own last release (`v0.07`, 2016 — so
  apt is *not* behind, there is simply nothing newer); `ptunnel` is frozen at `0.72`;
  `icmpsh` is dead (last push 2018, never released).
- **`sliver`'s currency note no longer hardcodes a patch count.** "TWO patches behind"
  was accurate when written and wrong within five months. It now states the shape — apt
  froze at `1.7.1-0kali4` while upstream kept releasing — and points at
  `sliver-server version` instead of a number that rots.
- **Freeze and archive statuses added where the file asserted none.** `PrintSpoofer`
  (archived Sep 2024) was the last unmarked freeze in the target-dropped block; `hashid`
  is frozen at Jun 2022 while the line calls it "the cracking entrypoint"; the evasion
  payload-build paragraph carried no status for any of its five tools (`macro_pack` and
  `ScareCrow` archived, `Donut` alive, `sRDI` static since 2023). Each is **kept** — these
  target behaviours and formats that have not moved — with the reason stated.
- **The `ConfuserEx` pointer now names the `mkaring` fork.** Canonical
  `yck1509/ConfuserEx` is archived and has not moved since 2019, so a bare "ConfuserEx"
  landed a reader in a dead repo — the failure the kwp-vs-`iphelix/pack` note already
  guards against elsewhere in the file.
- **`ligolo-ng` loses its "(upstream if repo build lags)" hedge.** Kali tracks it closely
  (`0.9.1-0kali1` within ~2 weeks of upstream `v0.9.1`), so the hedge invited a hand-built
  pivot that is almost never warranted.
- **The `hexyl` note's reason is narrower than it claimed.** "There is no `hexyl` package
  in Kali at all" is false: the `rust-hexyl` source package, which builds a `hexyl` binary
  package, has been imported into and removed from kali-rolling repeatedly (0.4.0, 0.5.1,
  0.7.0, 0.8.0, most recently 0.16.0-4), following Debian testing. It is out **right now**,
  so the conclusion — keep it out, it would hand `check-packages.sh` an unresolvable name
  — is unchanged, but it can return without warning.
- **`rusthound-ce`'s version pair replaced with its cadence.** The quoted
  `v2.4.91 -> v2.5.2 in seven weeks` had itself gone stale (seven releases shipped in the
  eight weeks to Aug 2026). The mechanical reason it stays out of `redup` — cargo, no
  self-updater, `go_fast_movers` is go-only — is unchanged.
- **`redup`'s ffuf/gobuster note now separates ownership from currency.** "apt-packaged
  ones (gobuster/ffuf) update via `up`" implied apt keeps them current. apt *owns* them,
  so `up` is the only correct route and neither belongs in `go_fast_movers` — but kali's
  ffuf is `2.1.0` (Jan 2024) against an upstream that resumed releasing at `2.2.x`. The
  routing claim stands; the currency implication does not.
- **`packages.yml` now emits `::warning::` annotations** as well as its job summary. It
  stays advisory — Kali is rolling, and a package that vanishes mid-migration must not red
  an unrelated PR — but summary-only proved to be the same as silent: three unresolvable
  apt names sat in the manifest while the job reported them into a page nobody opened and
  exited 0 every week. Annotations surface on the Checks and Files tabs without changing
  any exit code. Its header also claimed you could make the job blocking by dropping a
  `|| true` that does not exist in the file; the real lever is the `exit 0` at the end of
  the resolve step.

- **Five currency annotations corrected** (#211). `adaptixc2`'s said upstream publishes zero
  releases so there is "no tag to judge staleness by" and that it rolls on `main` — both
  false: v1.0/v1.1/v1.2 are tagged, `main` last moved 2026-03-04, and work is on version
  branches. That premise was load-bearing for the fingerprinted-default-profiles warning
  above it. `sliver`'s apt lag is two patches, not "~a patch". `caldera` entered the Apache
  Incubator 2025-12-19, not May 2026. `rusthound-ce`'s "collectors aren't daily-churn"
  reasoning is dead (v2.4.91 → v2.5.2 in seven weeks) — the conclusion survives for a
  mechanical reason instead: cargo, no self-updater, and redup's loop is go-only. And
  `mitm6` finally gets the FROZEN note that `kerbrute` and `havoc` already carried.
- **`hexyl`'s absence from the manifest is now recorded there.** It is not a Kali package at
  all, so listing it would hand `check-packages.sh` an unresolvable name; the deferral to
  dotgibson/dotfiles-core#395 is written down instead, so the packages list and
  `install/tools.lst` agree.

- **Three of the four field references now point at the corpus.** `exploitdev`, `ippsec`
  and `evasion` listed their sibling references but omitted `~/companion` (`htpx`), which
  `hacktheplanet` has always carried. `evasion` was the sharpest case: its
  "Network-filter & egress bypass (C2 channels)" fold is prose-only by design, and the six
  entries holding the actual commands (`dns-tunnel-c2`, `icmp-tunnel-c2`,
  `domain-fronting-cdn`, `https-beacon-sliver`, `mtls-c2-sliver`, `web-service-c2-telegram`)
  live only in the corpus — with no route to them from the doc that needed them most. Its
  footer is also restyled to match the other three (`~/name` + alias, not `offensive/name`).
- **`evasion` opened with bare `vim`.** It told you to run `vim ~/evasion`, bypassing the
  read-only opener that exists so an errant `:w` cannot publish engagement data — the one
  reference of the four that did. Now leads with `evade`, matching `exploitdev`.
- **`hacktheplanet` gained the two commands the corpus had and it did not** (#212).
  The coercion fold described "many vectors" but never showed the MS-DFSNM one, and the
  pivot fold described ligolo-ng in prose with no command line at all. Both are now present,
  so the header's claim that these entries are "covered better below" holds again.

- **The last OS-layer file is gone, and the role wiring is Core's now.** `os/kali.conf`
  carried the `prefix + e` engagement popup as *role* config living in an *OS* overlay
  (`$CONFIG/tmux/os.conf`), because Core had exactly one tmux overlay hook when it was
  written. Vendoring Core **v4.13.1** brings the second hook, so the binding moves to
  **`offensive/offensive.conf`** → `$CONFIG/tmux/role.conf`, and `os/` is deleted
  outright. Two consequences worth stating plainly:
  - `role.conf` is sourced **last** by Core's `tmux.conf`, after Core's own bindings.
    `os.conf` is sourced before them, so a future Core `bind e` could have silently
    taken the key back. That ordering is the actual reason the hook exists.
  - `dotfiles-Debian` and this repo no longer race for `$CONFIG/tmux/os.conf`. Until
    now whichever bootstrap ran last won it; the OS repo owns band 80 alone again.
  The battery and net-speed status probes did **not** move here — they are OS-native and
  `dotfiles-Debian`'s `os/debian.conf` already carries them.
- **`bootstrap.sh` calls `blib_link_role_layer` instead of hand-rolling three links.**
  The block it replaces had already drifted from `dotfiles-Defense`'s copy of the same
  wiring: Defense honoured `BLIB_DRY` when dropping the stale pre-v4 link and this repo
  did not, so `--dry-run` mutated the box here and not there. One shared definition ends
  that class of drift.
- **Templates moved to `$CONFIG/offensive/templates`** (from `$CONFIG/kali/templates`) —
  named for the role rather than the distro, matching Defense's `$CONFIG/defense/`. The
  two shipped docs that quote the path by hand, `offensive/hacktheplanet` and
  `offensive/ippsec`, are updated in the same change. Core deliberately declined a compat
  symlink, since it would preserve a `~/.config/kali/` on a repo no longer called Kali.
- **Bootstrap now cleans up after the old wiring.** A box bootstrapped before this change
  carries `$CONFIG/tmux/os.conf` and `$CONFIG/kali/templates` pointing into this
  checkout; both dangle afterwards. Each is removed **only when it is a symlink resolving
  inside this repo**, so a box also running `dotfiles-Debian` never has that repo's live
  `os.conf` touched, and `--dry-run` only reports.

- **This repo is now a pure Role layer.** It used to be both the OS-native layer for
  Kali *and* the offensive role on top. `dotfiles-Debian` now covers the Debian family
  properly and accepts `ID=kali` as a first-class target, so the OS half moved there and
  what is left here is the role. Concretely:
  - **Removed:** `os/kali.zsh`, `os/kali.gitconfig`, `install/packages.txt`,
    `install/tool-versions.env`, `scripts/update-tool-checksums.sh`, `wsl/`,
    `ssh/config`. Every one of them has an equivalent in `dotfiles-Debian`, whose
    package list carries the Kali tier as `# only:kali` annotations.
  - **`bootstrap.sh` is distro-agnostic and installs nothing by default.** The `ID=kali`
    gate, the apt base install, the `full-upgrade`, the SHA-pinned `verified_install`
    block, the carapace `.deb`, the 1Password repo and the `/etc/wsl.conf` write are all
    gone — they belong to the OS-native layer. What replaces them is a **report**: a
    three-state host-tool probe (on `$PATH` / present-but-unreachable / missing),
    modelled on `dotfiles-Defense`.
  - **`--install` is the new opt-in.** On Kali it apt-installs
    `install/offensive-packages.txt` as before. On any other Debian-family box it
    installs a small **portable subset** via pipx (impacket, certipy-ad, netexec,
    bloodyAD, ldapdomaindump) and go (nuclei, gobuster, ffuf, kerbrute). On anything
    else it refuses and says why rather than guessing at a package manager.
  - **`--no-offensive` and `--no-upgrade` are accepted but inert**, with a note — the
    behaviour they asked for is now the default, so aborting on them would be worse than
    honouring them.
  - **`--links-only` with `--install` is refused**: one wires symlinks only, the other
    installs packages.
- **`install/tools.lst` is new** — the host-tool probe list, and the one place it is
  written. Twin of `dotfiles-Defense`'s. A command belongs there only if
  `offensive/offensive.zsh` probes or invokes it by bare name.
- **`offsync` replaces this repo's half of `dotsync`.** `dotsync` came from
  `os/kali.zsh` and now belongs to the OS-native layer (band 80). `offensive.zsh`
  exports `$DOTFILES_OFFENSE` and binds `offsync` to it — a distinct verb, because
  reusing `dotsync` at band 85 would silently shadow the OS layer's.
- **`test/check-packages.sh` and `make packages-check` now check one manifest**
  (`install/offensive-packages.txt`); `make tool-checksums` is gone with the pins.

- The gating workflows (`lint`, `bootstrap`, `companion`, `routine-filter`) no
  longer use trigger-level path filters: a `paths:`-skipped workflow produces no
  check run, so requiring one would hang every non-matching PR.
- `os/kali.gitconfig` no longer duplicates Core's `init.defaultBranch`, and
  `os/kali.zsh` no longer duplicates Core's `~/.local/bin` PATH prepend.
- `offensive/templates/engagement.md` documents the layout `mkengagement` actually
  creates.

### Known gaps

- **pipx installs different binary names than Kali does.** PyPI's impacket ships
  `secretsdump.py`, not Kali's `impacket-secretsdump` wrapper; `certipy-ad` ships
  `certipy`. `offensive.zsh` probes the Kali names, so those `HAVE_*` flags do not fire
  on a pipx box. The bootstrap's probe recognises both names, so the report is honest;
  teaching the shell layer to resolve both is a separate change.
- **The WSL Git-Credential-Manager note** that lived in `os/kali.gitconfig` (how to
  point `credential.helper` at the Windows host's GCM) did not travel with the file.
  It belongs in `dotfiles-Debian`'s git overlay now that that repo owns WSL.
